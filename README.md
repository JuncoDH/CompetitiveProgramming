# README
This repository contains all the code I use for Competitive Programming. It has the solutions of lasts contests, implementation of all kinds of algorithms, notebooks and solutions to private online judges.

You can contact me via email ([juncodelasheras@outlook.com](mailto:juncodelasheras@outlook.com)) or via Linkedin ([here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junco-de-las-heras-valenzuela/)).

## Content:
- Contests
  > Here is the code of onsite - local contests, some of them also have the pdf of the problems.
- Implementations
  - ad_hoc (creative solutions for specific problems, not general problems).
  - Bitmask (0's, 1's, binary).
  - DataStructures (big classes with a lot of functionality).
  - DP (Dinamic Programming).
  - Environment (IO, Chronometer, Bash).
  - Geometry (Euclidean Plane and Point).
  - Graphs.
  - Hash (Object hash).
  - Math (Mathematics).
  - Random (Random algorithms, they work a % of times).
  - RangeQuery (Data Structures for Range Query).
  - Strings (Strings and automata).
  - Template (C++, Java and Python templates).
  > My implementation of all kinds of algorithms, ready to copy-paste them for a contest!
- Notebook
  > Past notebooks for onsite contests.
- Online_Judges
  - AceptaElReto.
  - SPOJ.
  - UVA.
  > Code solutions of private judges.
